Developing `smif`
=================

*smif* is under active development at `github.com/nismod/smif`_

Install
-------

The :code:`smif` codebase is contained in ``src/smif``.

Install the library in develop mode using the command::

    python setup.py develop

If you also wish to use the GUI while using smif in develop mode, you'll need
to navigate to the ``src/smif/app`` folder and run the commands::

    npm install
    npm run build

Testing
-------

We use `pytest`_ for testing, with tests under :code:`tests/` matching the module
and class structure of :code:`smif/`.

Install requirements for testing::

    pip install -r test-requirements.txt


Run tests::

    python setup.py test


Documentation
-------------

We use `better-apidoc <https://github.com/goerz/better-apidoc>`_ for building
documentation in reStructuredText under :code:`smif/docs` and the
`Numpy style docstrings <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/example.py>`_
that are used throughout the codebase. Documentation is generated and hosted
on `readthedocs <http://smif.readthedocs.org>`_.

There is a makefile that helps building the docs locally::

    cd docs/
    make html

This generates a local version in :code:`smif/docs/_build/html` that can be opened with a browser.


Versioning
----------

:code:`smif` is currently pre-1.0, so API and usage are liable to change. After
releasing a first major version, we intend to follow `semantic versioning`_, with
major versions for any incompatible changes to the public API.


Releases
--------

`smif`_ is deployed as a package on the Python Package Index, PyPI. A full guide
to `packaging`_ and distributing projects is available online.

Deployment to PyPI is handled by Travis CI.

To make a release, create an annotated tag, and submit a pull request::

    git tag -a v0.2.0       # create annotated tag (will need a message)
    git describe            # show current commit in relation to tags

You'll need to specify you tag to push either using the ``--tags`` flag or
the tag name::

    git push upstream master --tags
    git push upstream v0.2.0        # alternatively


Conventions
-----------

The `numpydoc`_ docstring conventions are used for inline documentation, which
is used to generate the module reference documentation visible at `readthedocs`_
and which can also be generated by running ``python setup.py docs``

Linting is handled by `pre-commit`_ hooks, which can be installed from the root
of the repository using::

    pre-commit install


Errors and messages
-------------------

As a general guideline, `smif`_ fails fast, with errors that users can understand in
context, whether they call smif through the python api, CLI, HTTP API or GUI.

When handling errors, we raise custom exceptions (with an informative name and
message) which can be communicated out through STDERR, HTTP response or error box.

In normal operations, we catch all errors from the standard library and other
dependencies close to where they may arise, re-raising with a custom `SmifException` if it
can't be handled directly.

For example:

.. code:: python

    try:
        networkx.topological_sort(graph)
    except networkx.NetworkXUnfeasible as err:
        raise SmifNotImplementedError("JobGraphs must not contain cycles") from err


Error messages should contain concrete details from the immediate context if brief and
relevant. This might include names and small values, but not lists or serialisations of large
or even medium-sized data structures. Errors and messages can be extended with extra context
if we catch and re-raise further up the stack.


Error boundaries
----------------

There are three major boundaries where we catch and handle errors:
- around a job (a call to `Model.simulate`) - independent jobs shouldn't cause others to fail
- around a modelrun - independent modelruns shouldn't cause others to fail
- around the smif process - errors should be reported, followed by a clean exit if the process
  cannot continue.

    :alt: smif error boundaries
    :target: _images/error_boundaries.png

At program boundaries, we catch anything inheriting from `SmifException` and pass on the
message. Stack traces are only shown if running in debug mode, or as the result of a
programming error (we missed something - it's a bug).


Logging
-------

Log messages should be used sparingly, following the
`python guidelines`<https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#when-to-use-logging>:

- print() displays console output for ordinary usage of the CLI (respond with a message or
  similar usual channel for API/GUI)
- CRITICAL errors are the  last thing logged before a daemon is forced to quit (scheduler or
  server process)
- ERROR level errors are communicated to user, typically causing jobs, requests or batch
  jobs to fail.
- WARN indicates an event that a client may not be able or need to do anything about -
  including error handling and unexpected events (failover, fallback). Use `warnings.warn`
  if client code should be modified, for example if deprecating a method.
- INFO reports on events that occur during normal operation (e.g. start/stop modelrun, jobs)
- DEBUG records events at a finer grain. Prefer introducing debug statements temporarily for
  debugging, but not to commit them without justification.

CRITICAL, ERROR and WARN are shown with any verbosity level, and we should not typically expect
to see any of them.

INFO messages are shown at the first level of verbosity (`-v`).

DEBUG messages are shown at the second level of verbosity (`-vv`).

Data flow
---------

Locating the data required by a particular simulation model could become
complicated. A data input may be provided as scenario data or as the
output from another model. Scenario data vary between model runs as different
scenarios are explored. Model outputs vary between model runs and possibly
within model runs, as coupled models iterate to find stable solutions to
loops in the dependency graph or as decision algorithms run multiple simulations
to explore possible interventions.

The two abstractions introduced are a ``DataInterface`` and a ``DataHandle``. A
``DataInterface`` has responsibility for accessing and persisting data and
results, for example to a file system or database. A ``DataHandle`` has
responsibility for directing a simulation model's requests to the correct
dataset, given the modelrun, requesting model, particular spatial or temporal
resolution, and current iteration state. The containing layers - ``ModelRun``,
``SosModel``, ``ModelSet`` - must incrementally add and update details when
creating a specialised ``DataHandle`` to pass in to each simulation model.

This class diagram show part of the API to ``DataInterface`` and the smaller API
to ``DataHandle`` which internally makes use of ``DataHandle``'s private
attributes.
