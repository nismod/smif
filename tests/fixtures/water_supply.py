"""First approximation of a simulation models to be used in the framework

Simulation Models
-----------------

There are a bunch of very simple simulation models to demonstrate different
functionality.

`ExampleWaterSupplySimulation`: simulation only, no assets

`ExampleWaterSupplySimulationWithAsset`: simulation of water with outputs also
a function of assets

`ExampleWaterSupplySimulationWithReservoir`: simulation with outputs a function
of a reservoir level which should be persistent over years


Wrappers Around the Models
--------------------------

Around each of the above simulation models, subclassed wrappers based on
:class:`SectorModel` are used to present a consistent API

`WaterSupplyPython` - wraps `ExampleWaterSupplySimulation`

`WaterSupplyPythonAssets` - wraps `ExampleWaterSupplySimulationAsset`

`WaterSupplyExecutable` - wraps `water_supply_exec.py`
