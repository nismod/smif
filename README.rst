Description
===========

**smif** is a framework for handling the creation of system-of-systems
models.  The framework handles inputs and outputs, dependencies between models,
persistence of data and the communication of state across years.

This early version of the framework handles simple models that simulate the
operation of a system.
**smif** will eventually implement optimisation routines which will allow,
for example, the solution of capacity expansion problems.

Setup and Configuration
=======================

**smif** is written in pure Python (Python>=3.5), with very few dependencies.

A word from our sponsors
========================

**smif** was written and developed at the `Environmental Change Institute,
University of Oxford <http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk>`_ within the
EPSRC sponsored MISTRAL programme, as part of the `Infrastructure Transition
Research Consortium <http://www.itrc.org.uk/>`_.
