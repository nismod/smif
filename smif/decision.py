"""The decision module handles the three planning levels

Currently, only pre-specified planning is implemented.

The choices made in the three planning levels influence the set of interventions
and assets available within a model run.

The interventions available in a model run are stored in the
:class:`~smif.intervention.InterventionRegister`.

When pre-specified planning are declared, each of the corresponding
interventions in the InterventionRegister are moved to the BuiltInterventionRegister.

Once pre-specified planning is instantiated, the action space for rule-based and
optimisation approaches can be generated from the remaining Interventions in the
InterventionRegister.
